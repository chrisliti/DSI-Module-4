## Overview

This project is the capstone project for my Data Science Intensive Africa 2022 course.

Human society needs to increase food production by an estimated 70% by 2050 to feed expected population of about 9 billion people.With 75% of the 9.2 million person labor force engaged in farming, the agricultural sector is the mainstay of the Kenyan economy. Plant disease outbreaks are increasing and threaten food security for the vulnerable in many areas of the world. Infectious diseases reduce potential yield by an average of 40% in developing world. Smartphones are a potential tool for reducing the impact of plant diseases. As of 2018 30% of 50 million kenyans were reported to own a smartphone.

The project aims to help alleviate the above stated hunger problems contributed to by plant diseases by developing 2 applications:

A plant disease classification web application.
A plant disease object detection web application.
The reasoning between the 2 applications is the classifier can be used by small scale farmers via smart phones, whereas the object detection model can be utilized in large scale farming. The object detection model can be integrated with drones for real time disease detection and possibly can help in automated spraying of infected plants.
